# PhantomOrifice
A collection of code, CAD files, and videos relating to my dissertation on the development of an adjustable orifice plate for the ring vortex phantom device.


Contents:

Misc
- phantom device 3D model: .pdf file containing a 3D embed of the ring vortex phantom device, which can be manipulated to explore the device. To view this, download and open with Adobe Reader, and enable 3D content.

Code (all used in Chapter 3.2.1 of the dissertation)
- RV_MotorCode: Arduino code used to run the motor to generate ring vortices using the phantom device. Code by Alana Matthews.
- RV_EncoderCode: MATLAB code used to run the encoder while generating ring vortices using the phantom device. Code by Alana Matthews with comments by Janine Flohr.
- RV_ManualPositionTracker: MATLAB code used to analyse video data to track the position of the ring vortex throughout the tank. Based upon code by Alana Matthews, with changes and comments by Janine Flohr.
- RV_ManualShapeTracker: MATLAB code used to analyse video data to quantify the shape of the ring vortex throughout the tank. Code by Janine Flohr.

STL files
- orifice 1-10: .stl files of the geometrical test orifices, used throughout Chapter 5 of the dissertation.
- orifice 11-13: .stl files of the adjustable orifice design concepts, explored throughout Chapters 6, 7, 8 of the dissertation respectively.

Animations
- orifice 11-13: video animations of how the mechanism of each adjustable orifice works. Created by Alana Matthews with comments by Janine Flohr.
